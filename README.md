This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)


## Getting Started
All yarn commands should be run from the `root` directory.

**Commands**
- `yarn dev`: run a development build with hot reload
- `yarn build`: build a production ready app that is compiled in `/dist`
- `yarn preview`: local preview of the result of `yarn build` (performance testing)
- `yarn validate`: validate all code against linting and formatting rules
- `yarn repair`: correct all linting and formatting errors that can be repaired automatically
